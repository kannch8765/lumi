"""Lumi pipeline orchestrator.

This module wires the four L-layer agents (L1 Identity, L2 Eligibility,
L3 Level Filter, L4 Timeline) into an ADK :class:`SequentialAgent` and
adds a final parallel-output ranking step. The orchestrator itself
holds NO tools — it is pure delegation (CONTEXT.md #10 — the tool
whitelist is the kill switch; the orchestrator cannot do anything its
sub-agents cannot do, and it owns no tool surface that could become a
new attack vector).

Pipeline shape::

    lumi_pipeline (SequentialAgent)
    └── l1_identity        -> state['identity']      :class:`IdentityProfile`
    └── l2_eligibility     -> state['eligibility']   :class:`EligibilityResult`
    └── l3_level           -> state['level_filter']  :class:`LevelFilterResult`
    └── l4_timeline        -> state['timeline']      :class:`TimelineResult`
    └── timeline_ranker    -> state['ranked_timeline'] (TimelineResult, sorted)

The first four sub-agents are the 4-layer pipeline (ARCHITECTURE.md
§Agent Pipeline). The fifth is a non-LLM code step — a thin ADK
agent whose ``instruction`` is a no-op and whose ``output_key`` is
written by an ``after_agent_callback`` that runs
:func:`app.ranking.rank_timeline_entries` against ``state['timeline']``.
This keeps the parallel-ranking stage inside the SequentialAgent
boundary so the pipeline remains a single ADK ``agent`` object that
callers can hand to a :class:`~google.adk.runners.Runner`.

Injecting the user's raw query
==============================

L1's prompt reads the user's message from the conversation, NOT from
a tool parameter — L1 has no tools by design. Callers therefore pass
the query into the pipeline as the user-role message of the first
``Content`` they hand to ``Runner.run_async``. This keeps the
orchestrator agent itself tool-free (no need for a session-state
forwarder tool) and matches the standard ADK conversation pattern.
